# Java Distributed Systems

### Description

1. > In this project I used Java, Hibernate, RabbitMQ and MySQL for distributed systems design.
2. >Addition I used Postman API client to try HTTP methods.
3. > I created java object(Entity) classes and interfaces.
4. > I mapped objects to relational-database xml based through Hibernate ORM.
5. > I made it possible for the user to use interfaces to use CRUD processes in each entity class.
6. > I used TheMovieDb API and get movies details from with this API.Then i created Object DTO class to get approtiate details what i want to return response to user and store in MySQL database.
7. > I used RabbitMQ work-queues concept to provide communicate each module and theirs message concurrency as well as stable.
8. > I created a `my_project`database in MySQL and tables for each entity class. I used transaction queries to provide durable database state.I applied ACID principles in MySQL database side while was creating database as well as queries.
9. > I created basic `mainpage` on localhost domain. User, with http methods on localhost, it can access as desired by entering the movie id to search and view.
